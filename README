= undoable: an activerecord undo plugin


It is based on RUR(Rails-Undo-Redo @ http://github.com/psq/rails-undo-redo) plugin.

With undoable, 
 - any active record operation (create, update, delete) can have undo, and it will include all the associations as well
 - active-records with awesome_nested_set (http://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set/tree/master) will support undo
 - any transaction with changes to multiple active-records can have undo
                                                                             
Installation
 - As a rails plugin, 
		script/plugin install git@github.com:nilakanta/undoable.git

Setup
 - Need to generate a migration to add two tables "UndoTransactions" and "UndoRecords" by
	 	script/generate add_undoable_tables
